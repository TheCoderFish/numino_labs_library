**Neighborhood Library Service – Take-Home Test**

---

**Overview**  
A small neighborhood library wants a new App to manage its members, books, and lending operations. You must build this service using:

* **Python** for the server implementation

* **REST or gRPC** with **Protocol Buffers** for the service interface

* **PostgreSQL** as the data store

---

**Functional Requirements**

* The library needs to track:

  * **Books** (title, author, etc.)

  * **Members** (name, contact info, etc.)

  * **Borrowing/Returning** operations (who borrowed what, when, etc.)

At a minimum, your App should allow the library staff to:

1. **Create/Update** records for books and members.

2. **Record** when a member borrows a book.

3. **Record** when a borrowed book is returned.

4. **Query** or list borrowed books in some fashion (e.g., all books a certain member has out).

You may include more functionality if you see fit (e.g., handling overdue books, tracking fines, due dates, etc.), but the above points are the core requirements.

**Your Task**

1. **Design the Database Schema**

   * Decide on the tables/entities you’ll need, how they relate, and what fields/columns belong in each.

   * You’ll store this data in PostgreSQL.

2. **Define the gRPC-Web Service(use REST if you are not comfortable with gRPC web)**

   * Create one or more `.proto` files with the necessary Protobuf message types and service definitions.

   * Determine which RPC methods (and their request/response messages) are needed to support the core library operations.

3. **Implement the Python gRPC or REST API Server**

   * Write Python code to spin up an API server.

   * In each API method, interact with your PostgreSQL database (create/read/update records, etc.).

4. **Documentation/Delivery**

   * Provide a short **README** detailing how to:

     * Set up the database (scripts or Docker instructions, etc.).

     * Generate or compile the `.proto` files (if needed).

     * Run the Python server (command-line steps, required libraries, environment variables).

   * Include any necessary files or folders so another developer can easily build, run, and test your service.

5. **Minimal Frontend**

   * Provide web frontend by using React ([next.js](http://next.js) preferably).

**Evaluation Criteria**

1. **Schema Design**

   * Clarity, normalization, and use of relationships in PostgreSQL.

2. **Service Interface**

   * How intuitive and well-structured your REST / gRPC  endpoints and Protobuf messages are.

3. **Code Quality**

   * Organization, readability, and maintainability of your code.

4. **Documentation**

   * Ease of setup and clear explanation of how to test the service.

---

**Tip (Optional)**

* Consider adding **error handling** for cases like trying to borrow a book that’s already checked out.

* Implementing **validation** (e.g., ensuring valid inputs for new records).

* Show how a client might call your service (e.g., providing a sample script).
